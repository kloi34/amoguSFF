# amoguSFF
The jank community-driven and open-source competitive ~SV~ SFF plugin

![steam_workshop_preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c32da09-ef18-45bc-a3d8-5c15a79856fc)

Ported/based on [amoguSV](https://github.com/kloi34/amoguSV), but worse.

## Known Issues

- Deleting SFFs does not work
- Does not delete existing SFFs automatically when placing SFFs (it will keep overlapping sections unlike amoguSV, which automatically deletes the old section)
